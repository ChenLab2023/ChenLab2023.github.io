<p>Welcome to the Sujun Chen Lab</p>
<p>The Chen laboratory applies a variety of genomic, epigenomic experimental and computational approaches to elucidate the regulation in cancer development, progression and drug response. Combine the experimental and computational expertise, we are in a unique position to make major contributions to both the general understanding of cancer biology and the improvement of epigenetic therapy. </p>
